# ColourCloudEdit

A literally _transformative_ technology

## What is ColourCloudEdit?

- It is a simple widget that allows you to transform the colours in an image
- It finds a palette for your image
- It provides a simple, intuitive interface to edit that palette 
- It transforms your image in realtime giving you instant feedback

## How does it work?

- You feed it your pixels
- It digests your pixels (using OpenGL compute)
- It provides a widget

## Who wrote it?

- James T. Griffin (PhD), a pure mathematician gone rogue
- I am committed to making my contributions available to all
- You don't need to master the statistics and topology that underpins ColourCloudEdit to use or implement it, I've done the hard work for you!

## What are the system requirements

- In principle any device with OpenGL4.3 or OpenGL ES 3.1 should do, this includes Raspberry Pi 4 for example.  I am targeting Integrated GPUs in the first instance.

## Can I use it yet?

- not quite, but soon
- this is an opensource project, so everyone can use my demo and anyone can include it in their own software _(subject to their own licensing issues)_
- encourage the maintainers of your favourite graphics software to implement it and support its development!
